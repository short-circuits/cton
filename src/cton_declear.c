 * This file is an amalgamation of many separate C source files from CTON proj.
 * By combining all the individual C code files into this single large file,
 * the entire code can be compiled as a single translation unit. This allows 
 * many compilers to do optimizations that would not be possible if the files
 * were compiled separately.
 *
 * This file is all you need to compile CTON. To use CTON in other programs,
 * you need this file and the "cton.h" header file that defines the programming
 * interface to the CTON library.
